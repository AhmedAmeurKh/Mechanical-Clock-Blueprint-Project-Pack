## 10/15/2025 - Mechanical Clock Project -- Brain storming  

Today I spent time brainstorming the concept for my stepper-driven mechanical gear clock. I sketched out initial ideas for the gear layout, motor placement, and overall design. I also explored how to integrate the stepper motor with the gears for precise movement and considered materials for laser cutting. It was mostly planning and idea exploration, setting a solid foundation for the build ahead.

Summary in a few words: Brainstorming, gear layout planning, and stepper motor integration ideas.
