# Mechanical-Clock-Blueprint-Project-Pack
Stepper-driven laser-cut mechanical gear clock with LEDs
---
Overview & Goals:
- Build a medium-sized 40cm laser-cut wall clock with visible gears driven by 28BYJ-48 stepper motors.
- The goal is to achieve a polished mechanical design with LEDs, featuring accurate timekeeping using a DS1302 RTC.
- Learn how to use GitHub and Fusion 360.

Features:
- Laser-cut MDF gears and frame - Stepper-driven gear train (one 28BYJ-48 used for power distribution/reduction) 
- Arduino UNO control via ULN2003 driver boards - DS1302 RTC module for accurate timekeeping
- Touch sensor module for simple UI (set time / enter adjust mode) ( still thinking about it)
- Optional LED strip for subtle backlight/visualization
- USB or battery power
